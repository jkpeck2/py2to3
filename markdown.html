<pre class="example"><code>
STATS CONVERT PYTHON
FILES=&quot;C:/code/mycode.sps&quot; OUTPUTLOC="C:/convertedcode".
</code></pre>

<pre class="example"><code>
STATS CONVERT PYTHON
FILES=&quot;C:/code/**&quot; OUTPUTLOC="C:/convertedcode".
</code></pre>

<p>The command accepts a file, or a wildcard file expression
of Statistics syntax and/or Python code and converts any Python 2 code to Python 3.
For syntax files, it extracts BEGIN PROGRAM PYTHON, BEGIN PROGRAM PYTHON2, or BEGIN PROGRAM blocks,
converts them to Python 3, and reinserts the converted code in place of the extracted
code.  It updates the block start to BEGIN PROGRAM PYTHON3.</p>

<p><strong>FILES</strong> specifies the files to convert.  It can be a 
plain file name with an sps extension or a Python file with a .py extension
 or a file wildcard expression such as "c:/code/*.sps".
<p>Any files with other exensions are ignored, so *.* would process only .py and .sps files.</p>
<p>If the Python 2 code has errors in it, the conversion will fail.  Occasionally
the code conversion will be incomplete, and notes to that effect are displayed if detected.
Note, however, that while conversions will be syntactically correct, they are not guaranteed
to be perfectly accurate.  As an example, x/y in Python 2 does integer division if the
terms are integers while
in Python 3, the operation is float division.  The / would need to be changed to //
to preserve the intent, but the converter cannot do this.</p>
<p><strong>OUTPUTLOC</strong> specifies the location where the converted files
should be written.  If the location does not already exist, it will be created.  Output files
have the same subdirectory structure as the inputs but with the head of the input directory
specification replaced with the OUTPUTLOC specification.</p>
<p><strong>INCLUDESUBS</strong> If ** is used in the file expression, the search for input
files will recurse through subdirectories if INCLUDESUBS is yes.  For example, FILES="c:/code/**/*.py" would process
code and all its subdirectories for Python files.  FILES="c:/code/**" would process both Python and
syntax files.</p>
<p><strong>COPYALL</strong> specifies whether files that are not changed by conversion either because
the Python is already valid Python 3 or the syntax file does not contain any Python 2 blocks are copied.</p>
<p><strong>OVERWRITE</strong> specifies whether files in the target locations are overwritten
or not, if possible.</p>

<p> The actual conversions are done by the Python lib2to3 module that is part of the
Python standard library.</p>

<p>An additional log file named conversionMessages.txt is written to the output location root.</p>
